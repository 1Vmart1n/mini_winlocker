This is a small "Winlocker" written in Python. This "winlocker" blocks mouse movement, and after entering the CORRECT password, the system shuts down.

This "winlocker" also has disadvantages. First, it can be closed using the task manager. Also, this is inherently not a winlocker, but a window that is located above the others.

(this is one of the best prototypes)

P.S: Don't judge my code strictly, thanks
